    <p id="mongoDb_para">Create a Cluster
        This tutorial takes you through the steps to create a new Atlas cluster. To learn how to modify an existing Atlas cluster, see Modify a Cluster.
        
        Clusters can be either a replica set or a sharded cluster. This tutorial walks you through creating a replica set.
        
        Required Access
        To create a cluster, you must have Organization Owner or Project Owner access to the project.
        
        Considerations
        Clusters can span regions and cloud service providers. The total number of nodes in clusters spanning across regions has a specific constraint on a per-project basis.
        
        Atlas limits the total number of nodes in other regions in one project to a total of 40. This total excludes:
        
        Google Cloud regions communicating with each other
        
        Free clusters or shared clusters
        
        The total number of nodes between any two regions must meet this constraint.
        
        EXAMPLE
        If an Atlas project has nodes in clusters spread across three regions:
        
        30 nodes in Region A
        
        10 nodes in Region B
        
        5 nodes in Region C
        
        You can only add 5 more nodes to Region C because:
        
        If you exclude Region C, Region A + Region B = 40. 
        
        If you exclude Region B, Region A + Region C = 35, <= 40. 
        
        If you exclude Region A, Region B + Region C = 15, <= 40. 
        
        Each combination of regions with the added 5 nodes still meets the per-project constraint:
        
        Region A + B = 40 
        
        Region A + C = 40 
        
        Region B + C = 20 
        
        You can't create a multi-region cluster in a project if it has one or more clusters spanning 40 or more nodes in other regions.
        
        Contact Atlas 
        support
         for questions or assistance with raising this limit.
        
        Each Atlas project supports up to 25 database deployments. Please contact Atlas support for questions or assistance regarding the database deployment limit. To contact support, select Support from the left-hand navigation bar of the Atlas UI.
        
        If your Atlas project contains a custom role that uses actions introduced in a specific MongoDB version, you must delete that role before creating clusters with an earlier MongoDB version.
        
        Atlas clusters created after July 2020 use TLS version 1.2 by default.
        
        When you create a cluster, Atlas creates a 
        network container
         in the project for the cloud provider to which you deploy the cluster if one does not already exist.
        
        If you have a Backup Compliance Policy enabled, all new and existing clusters have Cloud Backup automatically enabled and use the project-level Backup Compliance Policy. Atlas augments any preexisting cluster-level policies to meet the minimum requirements of the Backup Compliance Policy. All new clusters use the Backup Compliance Policy unless the mininum requirements of the cluster-level backup policy expand beyond the mininum requirements of the Backup Compliance Policy.
        
        Procedure
        
        Atlas CLI
        
        Atlas UI
        To create one cluster in the specified project using the Atlas CLI, run the following command:
        
        atlas clusters create [name] [options]
        
        To watch for a specific cluster to become available using the Atlas CLI, run the following command:
        
        atlas clusters watch <clusterName> [options]
        
        To learn more about the syntax and parameters for the previous commands, see the Atlas CLI documentation for 
        atlas clusters create
         and 
        atlas clusters watch.
        
        TIP
        See: Related Links
        Install the Atlas CLI
        
        Connect to the Atlas CLI
        
        View Available Regions
        To list available regions that Atlas supports for new deployments using the Atlas CLI, run the following command:
        
        atlas clusters availableRegions list [options]
        
        To learn more about the command syntax and parameters, see the Atlas CLI documentation for 
        atlas clusters availableRegions list.
        
        TIP

        Install the Atlas CLI
        
        Connect to the Atlas CLI
        
        [1]	(1, 2) For replica sets, the data-bearing servers are the servers hosting the replica set nodes. For sharded clusters, the data-bearing servers are the servers hosting the shards. For sharded clusters, Atlas also deploys servers for the 
        config servers
        ; these are charged at a rate separate from the cluster costs.
